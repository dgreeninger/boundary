 Ways to integrate Vault and Boundary

# Boundary and Vault integrations
The integration between Boundary and Vault aims to improve two main areas of concern for organizations:

- Security posture in relation to remote access
- Workflow efficiency

Boundary and Vault achieve these two things by removing the requirement for the end-user to have to know about what the credentials are or have anything to do with using them to gain access to a resource.

From a security perspective, we can use dynamic, ephemeral credentials that are only valid for the lifetime of the session, unless a specific Time to live (TTL) has been attached to the Vault token that would result in a session having a finite amount of time.

The security benefits also extend past an organisation's internal team, but also caters for third-party or contractors that may need to access certain resources. It would be preferable to not expose credentials for resource access with temporary staff, whilst still ensuring that access is secure and granted in a timely manner.

Ensuring access is granted in a timely manner then leads to that improvement in workflow efficiency. This is the result of end-users not having to be concerned with credentials, therefore removing a large bottleneck, in relation to gaining credentials through access requests and the time associated with such a task.

# Credentials
Vault can work with Boundary to be a credential [store](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/credential-stores) and [library](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/credential-libraries), which allows for credentials to be stored in Vault and used by Boundary. There are two options here for configuration:

- Generic Secrets.
- SSH Certificates.

The Generic Secrets references a Vault Key-Value path, where static secrets are stored and can be used to broker credentials to the end-user when connecting to a target.

The SSH Certificates takes advantage of Vault being the CA for SSH certificates by utilising the [HashiCorp Vault SSH Secrets Engine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/ssh) and can inject SSH certificates into the Boundary session.

It is worth detailing that users must bring their own Vault deployment to Boundary.

## Brokered credentials

This feature was added in Boundary 0.4 and facilitates Boundary as a credential broker for infrastructure targets, by binding credentials with user sessions, and surfacing those credentials during session initialization, with the help of Vault.

An example workflow and use case for this feature would be database access. Certain teams within an organisation, such as finance, need to access sensitive data residing in a database. Irrespective of the frequency that the database needs to be accessed, having long-lived credentials that could be purposely or accidentally leaked, can pose a huge risk to a company.

If Boundary and Vault are added into this workflow, it mitigates this potential security risk. You can enable the Vault database secrets engine, with the relevant database plugin configured, to then be able to issue dynamic and short-lived database credentials to end-users. Organizations can set a limit on the amount of times these credentials are valid and once they have timed-out, access is automatically revoked.

Upon connecting to the database through Boundary, Boundary displays the newly generated credentials and displays to the end user to connect to the target.

## Injected credentials

Currently SSH certificate injection is the only type of injection possible with the integration between Boundary and Vault. 

Vault is configured to act as the certificate authority (CA), to ensure that the usersâ€™ authenticity is determined by a certificate signed by a trusted CA. When key pairs are generated dynamically, they are signed by Vault to then be used to access the resources. There are two options for the key pair generation, depending on the type of Vault endpoint that is used within the Boundary credential library for SSH certification using Vault.

`/issue` - Vault will generate the key pair for you and also sign it.

`/sign` - The Boundary controllers will generate the key pair to then send to Vault to sign.

<Note>
If Boundary uses Vault for secrets management, then one credential store equates to one Vault token. The number of Boundary targets that source credentials from the stores, the number of users connecting to the targets, the number of sessions that get created or how many credential libraries the credential store contains, all have no impact on the client count in Vault.
</Note>

When you connect to a target, which uses Vault for dynamic SSH certificates, a new certificate is generated for every target connection. As long as the target trusts the CA, then access is granted without you having any visibility into the credentials involved.
